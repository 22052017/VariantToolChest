This will test unioning two vcfs with no overlapping samples. One var
has a different alt. This should add both alts to the line. If we
encounter the same sample with different genotypes, it should be
omitted because we don't know which one to report.

Expected result:
20	14370	Pass
20	17330	Pass
20	1110696	Pass
20	1230237	Pass
20	1234567	Pass
