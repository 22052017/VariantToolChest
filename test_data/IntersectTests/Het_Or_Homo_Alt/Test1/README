This will test comparing two vcfs with one overlapping sample.
Any genotype that does not match between two samples with the same name
will not be considered an intersect. This will also test that no variants with
a Homo Ref sample are returned.

Expected result:
20	14370	Fail for Homo Ref
20	17330	Fail for non-matching sample genotype
20	1110696	Pass
20	1230237	Fail for Homo Ref
20	1234567	Pass
