This will test unioning two vcfs with an overlapping sample. If we
encounter the same sample with different genotypes, it should be
omitted because we don't know which one to report.

Expected result:
20	14370	Pass
20	17330	Fail for different refs( I think that this should actually pass - Mark W.)
20	1110696	Fail for matching sample with different genotype
20	1230237	Pass
20	1234567	Fail for matching sample with different genotype
