This will test comparing two vcfs with the one overlapping sample using the 
homo_alt option. If the overlapping sample has a differnt genotype in one file than in 
the other it should not be added. 

Expected result:
20	14370	Fail for different alt allele
20	14371	Fail for different genotype
20	17330	Pass
