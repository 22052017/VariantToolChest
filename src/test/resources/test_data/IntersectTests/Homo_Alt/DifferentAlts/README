This will test comparing two vcfs with one overlapping sample.
Using the Homo_Alt command only variants that are homozygous
alternate, with the same alternate allele, will be returned.
This tests for homozygous alternate calls that have different alternates. 

Expected result:
20	1110696	Pass
20	1234567	Fail because no alt is common among all samples
