This will test comparing two vcfs with one overlapping sample.
Any genotype that does not match between two samples with the same name
will not be considered an intersect. This will also test that the Alt
alleles intersect. Alt alleles intersect if at least one alternate allele
is the same. Ref alleles must also be identical

Expected result:
20	14370	Fail for different Alt alleles
20	17330	Fail for different Ref alleles
20	1110696	Pass because at least one alt allele overlaps
20	1230237	Fail for Homo Ref
20	1234567	Pass
