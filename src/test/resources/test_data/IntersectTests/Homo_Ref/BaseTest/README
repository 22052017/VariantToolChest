This will test comparing two vcfs with no overlapping sample.
Any genotype that does not match between two samples with the same name
will not be considered an intersect. This will also test that the Alt
alleles intersect. Alt alleles intersect if at least one alternate allele
is the same. Ref alleles must also be identical

Expected result:
20	14370	Fail for different Alt alleles
20	17330	Fail for Het Alleles
20	1110696	Fail for Alt alleles
20	1230237	Pass for Homo Ref
20	1234567	Fail because no alt is common among all samples
