This will test comparing two vcfs with the on overlapping sample using the 
Het option. The Het option requires that the samples contain a Ref allele too,
so if a sample is het for two different Alts, the variant will be excluded. Of
course homozygotes will also cause exclusion.

Expected result:
20	14370	Fail for homo ref
20	17330	Pass
20	1110696	Fail for homo alt
20	1110697 Pass
20	1230237	Fail for homo ref
20	1234567	Pass
