This will test comparing two vcfs with the on overlapping sample using the 
Het option. The Het option requires that the samples contain a Ref allele too,
so if a sample is het for two different Alts, the variant will be excluded. Of
course homozygotes will also cause exclusion.

Expected result:
20	14370	Fail for homo ref
20	17330	Pass
20	1110696	Fail for Het with two different alts
20	1230237	Fail for homo ref
20	1234567	Fail because sample has not all samples are heterozygote for the same alternate.
