This will test comparing two vcfs with the exact same samples using the 
MATCH_SAMPLE option. This will require that all samples match themselves
across variant pools.

Expected result:
20	14370	Pass
20	17330	Fail for non-matching sample genotype
20	1110696	Fail for non-matching sample genotype
20	1230237	Pass
20	1234567	Pass
