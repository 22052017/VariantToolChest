This will test comparing two vcfs with the two overlapping samples using the 
Match_Sample. This tests if variants with REF or ALT columns that are different are excluded and makes sure
that match sample is checking actual genotype and not just the numbers.


Expected result:
20	17330	Pass
20	1110696	Fail for different reference allele
20	1230237	Fail for different alternate allele
