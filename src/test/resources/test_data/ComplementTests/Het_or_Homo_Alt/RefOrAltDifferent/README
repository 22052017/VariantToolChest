This will test comparing two vcfs with the one overlapping sample using the 
het_homo_alt. This tests if variants with REF or ALT columns that are different are included form the first file.

Expected result:
20	17330	Fail because of all genotypes are the same
20	1110696	Pass for different reference allele
20	1230237	Pass for different alternate allele
